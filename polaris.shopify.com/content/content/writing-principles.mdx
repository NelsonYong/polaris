Our content guidelines help you think about the language you use in your products and apps. They provide clear suggestions so you can create better experiences.

[Each component](/components) includes specific guidelines for how to write for it.

## Be audience-obsessed

People rely on Shopify every day to run their businesses and need clear, actionable content to be successful. The language you use in the experiences you’re building makes a big difference to merchants. Take the time to understand who your audience is, what they need, and the language they use.

#### Tips
- Use plain language and industry-standard terms to improve understanding and bring clarity. Think about the words people use everyday, rather than what companies call things.
- Remove unnecessary or repeated words to focus and simplify your content.
- Write for small screens first, but consider all screen sizes. Constraints help you focus on the most important message.

## Be action-oriented
People use Shopify to get things done, whether they’re managing a store, fulfilling an order, or reviewing business analytics. Write your content to help readers understand and take the most important actions.

####  Tips
- Use strong, clear verbs so it’s obvious what action a person should take
- Prioritize the most important information and task — don’t make people work to find what they’re looking for
- Simplify complicated tasks into steps so they’re easier to understand
- Default to active voice to provide direction

## Be cohesive
Merchants don't see Shopify as a collection of different parts; it's a unified experience. Write cohesively so merchants can work without friction as they move throughout the admin.

####  Tips
- Writing using langauge that reflects how people think and the words they use
- Identify important actions (verbs) and objects (nouns) so you can use consistent language across touchpoints
- Describe actions or objects in the simplest way possible
- Find and remove any synonyms that might muddy an experience or slow down merchants

## Get rid of the clutter
Merchants are focused on running their business, making sales, and managing relationships with their customers. Make every word count in service of helping them run their business as effectively as possible.

#### Tips
- Treat words as visual elements of the experience; they should be easy to visually latch onto
- Make things as concise as possible; passive language and sentence fragments can be helpful in these situations.
- Read your content out loud. If you get tripped up or it doesn’t sound like something a human would say, your content needs to be edited.
